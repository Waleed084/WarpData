Here's a breakdown of the technologies you can use for different parts of your project:

### Frontend
1. **React**: For building the user interface.
2. **Material-UI**: For UI components, you can continue using this as it integrates well with React.
3. **React Chart Libraries**:
   - **Chart.js with React wrapper (react-chartjs-2)**: For rendering various types of charts like bar, pie, doughnut, line, area, and scatter charts.
   - **Recharts**: Another great option for creating responsive charts in React.
   - **Highcharts with React wrapper (highcharts-react-official)**: For advanced and interactive charting needs, including waterfall charts.

### Backend
1. **Node.js with Express**: For building the server-side logic.
2. **Database**:
   - **MongoDB**: For a NoSQL database, if you need flexibility in storing different types of data models.
   - **PostgreSQL**: For a relational database, if your data has clear relationships and you need strong ACID compliance.

### Data Processing
1. **node-xlsx** or **xlsx**: For reading Excel files in Node.js.
2. **Sequelize (for PostgreSQL)** or **Mongoose (for MongoDB)**: For database ORM (Object Relational Mapping), to handle the database operations easily.

### Data Visualization
1. **D3.js**: For advanced data manipulation and charting, although it has a steeper learning curve.
2. **Chart.js**: For simpler charting needs and ease of use with React.

### State Management
1. **Redux**: If your application grows and you need better state management.
2. **React Context API**: For simpler state management needs without additional libraries.

### File Upload and Processing
1. **Multer**: For handling file uploads in Node.js.
2. **PapaParse**: For parsing CSV files if you also need to handle CSV along with Excel.

### Deployment
1. **Heroku** or **Vercel**: For deploying your application.
2. **Docker**: For containerizing your application to ensure it runs consistently across different environments.

### Recommendations:
1. **Frontend**: 
   - Continue using Material-UI for the UI components.
   - Use `react-chartjs-2` for the charts due to its ease of use and variety of chart types.
   
2. **Backend**:
   - Use Node.js with Express for the server.
   - Use PostgreSQL for the database as it will help you maintain the structured format and handle sequences well.
   - Use Sequelize as the ORM for PostgreSQL.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Use `xlsx` for reading Excel files.
   - Use Sequelize to manage the data and ensure it is stored in the correct sequence based on time period.

By combining these technologies, you'll have a robust stack that can handle the complexities of your project while providing flexibility and ease of use.
